## About
Over the past few years, Teamfight Tactics has quickly become one of my favourite video games. While playing the game, I often find myself using Team Builder's on websites like [Lolchess.gg](https://lolchess.gg/builder?hl=en-US) and [Mobalytics](https://mobalytics.gg/tft/comp-builder) to plan for my next games and to help teach friends. Eventually, I decided that I wanted to build a similar app myself.
